## Preface
Lately I've been thinking a lot about the moment when something in your life shifts and you're suddenly 
different.

From my personal experience and talking with my friends, this seems to happen whenever we make a disovery
that sort-of collides with strong beliefs we've held. I like to think of our mental personality as a stone
structure. Typically, you go through life, lobbing things onto the top, maybe changing a stone or two here or
there. 

The structure is essentially us; our belifes, personality, things we're good at, things we know for certain.
The strucuture is us in our totality
But there are these moments when a discovery takes out one of the pillars that's holding up that building, and
then everything else relying on that pillar comes crashing down with it. It's a long-held belief. Something we
felt confident in arguing for. And now it's gone from a belief to question.

What's really interesting about that moment is that you'll feel this ever-growing urgency to act on it. 



### Key points

-> Our personality is like a stcuture
-> something collides with a pillar of that structure
-> a belief becomes a question, or multiple questions
-> Then, a choice (act as though nothing happenend, explore new meanings)
